# FPS 3D Game
## Overview
This project is a basic first-person shooter (FPS) game created using Unity and C#.

The game includes basic gameplay features such as enemy detection, health management, and a win/lose condition.

### Health System: 
#### The player can take damage from enemy attacks or specific objects and can heal using health packs scattered around the game.
